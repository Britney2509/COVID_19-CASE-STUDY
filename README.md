COVID-19 Case Study | Python Data Analysis

This project presents a data analysis case study on COVID-19 using Python. The analysis focuses on understanding the spread of infections, recovery patterns, mortality rates, and region-wise trends by processing and visualizing real-world pandemic data.

Key Analysis Areas

1)Trend Analysis – Daily and cumulative confirmed cases over time
2)Region-wise Impact – Comparison of cases, recoveries, and deaths
3)Recovery & Mortality Rates – Key health outcome metrics
4)Data Visualization – Clear insights through charts and plots
5)Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing and inconsistent data

Tools & Technologies

Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib / Seaborn
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Objective

To demonstrate strong Python, data analysis, and visualization skills by extracting meaningful insights from COVID-19 data to support data-driven understanding of pandemic trends.
